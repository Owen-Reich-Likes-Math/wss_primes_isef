# Universal P-Adic Stability in Generalized Fibonacci Sequences

This repository contains the computational framework and datasets used in the ISEF project "p-Adic Linear Forms in Logarithms and Stability Constraints on Wall--Sun--Sun Primes in Generalized Fibonacci Sequences".

The project identifies analytic bounds on the occurrence of **Wall–Sun–Sun primes** that serve as necessary conditions for counterexamples to Fermat's Last Theorem.

## 📂 Repository Structure

* **`/scripts`**: Python 3.14 suite for Lucas analysis at every angle
* **`/graphs_and_data`**: Huge datasets and crisp graphs for exploring Lucas sequence stability visually

## 🚀 Quick Start

To search a specific Lucas universe for anomalies:

```bash
python scripts/anomaly_universes_finder.py -P 1 -Q -1 --p_limit 100000

```

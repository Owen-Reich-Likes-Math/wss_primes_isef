# Scripts from very early experimentation with 'wall sun sun composites' which would have been composites with c^2 \mid F_{c - (c|D)}.
# These scripts were basically unused since the project quickly shifted away from the idea of a WSS composite
# However they show the statistical uniformity of c^2 \mid F_{c - (c|D)} which can probably be proven easily
